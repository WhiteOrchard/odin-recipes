# Intro

At Concrete, we believe clarity is power.
We speak the way we build: with intention, structure, and restraint. Our voice carries calm authority. Rooted in expertise.

Whether we are writing a product update, a line of copy, or an investor memo, our words reflect what we stand for: reliability, foresight, and modern elegance.
Voice is how we earn trust, line by line. More than with visual identity. 

We write like a trusted advisor. A strategist who brings order to complexity (remember that good old “simplexity” concept?). Never overwhelming. Always composed. And sometimes, when the moment calls for it, sharp as a blade.

# Guidelines in Writing

Following these principles will help us write & speak with intention.

### Keep the Property Owner in Focus

Our audience values clarity, efficiency, and control.

They are property owners, managers, or executives who have **a lot to manage** and **little time to waste**.

They don’t need us to sound impressive. They need us to be *clear, useful, and confident.*

→ We don’t write *at* people. We write *with* them in mind.

→ Respect their time. Respect their intelligence.

### Calm, Sharp, Strategic

We’re never loud. Never trying to go viral. Quite the opposite, actually.

We avoid exclamation marks, excessive enthusiasm, or hype language.

Our words carry weight because they are measured. That’s where the confidence lies.

We can be clever, even humorous, but never goofy.

We can be warm and welcoming, but never casual.

### Don’t Overengineer

We value minimalism. That applies to language too.

Say one thing well. Then stop. Let silence do the rest.

→ If you can say it in five words, don’t use seven.

→ If a sentence doesn’t add, it subtracts.

Keep things foundationally simple. That’s what makes space for impact.

### Use Visual Thinking

Metaphors and imagery are welcome — when done right.

A portal. A ledger. A dashboard. A safe. A balance. A foundation.

These visual cues help us tell stories without sounding abstract or aloof.

Use metaphor the way we use UI design: with restraint, and for clarity.

### Think in Adjectives

Assertive

Alluring

Outspoken

# Grammar

### Contractions

Contractions are encouraged. Certain circumstances may call for a more formal tone, but overall, we’re people too, and should talk like them.

### Emojis

- The occasional emoji can help convey emotion and add visual interest.
- Stick to using emojis only on social media accounts
- Some of our common emojis in our communications: 🏛️ ✅ ☀️ 👌 👏🏻 👇🏼
- Use emojis tastefully and in moderation (which means basically never)

# Color

Color is one of our most basic yet key assets in Concrete’s brand recognition. Yes, it may just be black and white, but that allows us to stay sleek and modern while having freedom in our graphic language, especially in these early days of the brand.

At its core, the palette consists of a refined monochrome base (charcoal, off-white) complemented by one accent colour that brings energy and clarity: a sharp industrial yellow.

The blue is simply used as a hint and some sort of variety to reinforce the brand across all touchpoints.

RGB (199, 222, 254) Cerulean Blue
RGB (255, 235, 90) Sunny Yolk
RGB (245, 243, 239) Bright Ceramic
RGB (18, 18, 18) Charcoal

## Some Basic Guidelines

1. Charcoal and Bright Ceramic will be the preferred canvas for all creations.
2. Use Cerulean ONLY for background. 
3. Use Sun Yolk sporadically. Picture it like Belgian weather: the sun comes out only every now and then and that’s why it’s so noticeable.

# What Defines “Graphic Elements?” (Examples)

Concrete’s visual identity is built on a foundation of clarity and modern minimalism. mirroring the structured environments we help manage. Graphic elements should mirror structured environments we help manage, while remaining clear.

### **1. Texture**

- **Architectural Surfaces:** Subtle textures like concrete, plaster or brushed metal can add tactile depth to digital design.
- **Soft Grain:** Minimal film grain or noise can evoke a sense of materiality and grounding, useful in backgrounds or large-format applications.
- **Light & Shadow:** Use natural light gradients and geometric shadows to reference real architectural spaces.

### **2. Vector Elements**

- **Grid Systems:** Thin-line modular grids can be used as subtle framing or layout guides. Avoid overwhelming the content.
- **Corner Brackets / Frames:** Sharp corner accents and geometric framing can create subtle emphasis or structure within layouts.
- **Icons:** Use the icon set consistently and sparingly. Simple, geometric, and in line with the core logo’s style.

### **3. Illustration & Imagery**

- **Abstract Diagrams / Minimal Line Art:** If illustration is used, it should follow architectural logic: clean, functional, and schematic. No doodles. We are not a coffee brand.
- **Photography Treatments:** Stick to neutral-toned photography with architectural compositions, clean lines, and natural light.
- Human presence, human faces will be added to help the platform remain warm and welcoming.
